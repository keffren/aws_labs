# AWS LABS

I'm excited to embark on a hands-on project where I'll combine AWS Services with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) skills using Terraform. 

In this project, I'll engage in hands-on labs sourced from AWS Skill Builder, Udemy courses, and FreeCodeCamp resources. These labs will be deployed and managed by me using Terraform, allowing me to gain practical experience while solidifying my Terraform skills.

## Labs

- [Hands-on-0:](/hands_on_0/README.md) Set up the aws account
- [Hands-on-1:](/hands_on_1/README.md) Deploy a multi tier web application
- [Hands-on-2:](/hands_on_2/README.md) Create CD pipeline

**Project Duration**

The timeline for this project is flexible, allowing me to progress at my own pace. It's an exciting journey to sharpen my cloud and IaC skills, and I can't wait to unlock the potential of AWS and Terraform!
