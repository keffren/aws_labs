# AWS LABS

I'm excited to embark on a hands-on project where I'll combine AWS Services with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) skills using Terraform. 

In this project, I'll engage in hands-on labs sourced from AWS , Udemy courses, FreeCodeCamp and Dev.to resources. These labs will be deployed and managed by me using Terraform, allowing me to gain practical experience while solidifying my Terraform skills.

## Labs

- **Hands-on-0:** [Set up the aws account](/hands_on_0/README.md)
- **Hands-on-1:** [Deploy a multi tier web application](/hands_on_1/README.md) 
- **Hands-on-2:** [Create CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeLine]((/hands_on_2/README.md))
- **Hands-on-3:** [Reminder App Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-serverless-aws-by-building-7-projects/)

**Project Duration**

The timeline for this project is flexible, allowing me to progress at my own pace. It's an exciting journey to sharpen my cloud and IaC skills, and I can't wait to unlock the potential of AWS and Terraform!
