# AWS LABS

I'm excited to embark on a hands-on project where I'll combine AWS Services with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) skills using Terraform. 

In this project, I'll engage in hands-on labs sourced from AWS , Udemy courses, FreeCodeCamp and Dev.to. These labs will be deployed and managed by me using Terraform, allowing me to gain AWS practical experience while solidifying my Terraform skills.

## Labs

The timeline for this project is flexible, allowing me to progress at my own pace. It's a thrilling journey to sharpen my cloud and IaC skills!
