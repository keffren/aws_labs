# Create Continuous Delivery Pipeline

## OVERVIEW

In this lab I will create an Reminder Serverless App.

The tutorial project is provided by *Sam Williams* from *freecodecamp*: [How to Learn Serverless AWS by Building 7 Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-serverless-aws-by-building-7-projects/)

### What I will accomplish

This project will teach me about Secondary Indexes in `Dynamo` as well as `Dynamo Time-To-Live`. I will also get to try either email automation with `Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)` or text messaging with `Simple Notification Service (SNS)`.

### Application architecture
