# AWS LABS

The purpose of this repository is to document some real DevOps projects on AWS from this Udemy course: [DevOps Projects | 20 Real Time DevOps Projects](https://www.udemy.com/share/103WIY3@wraVu0Li5V4Mlmx3PC3QofPOM3CJBlmqhG9LvmQG6wK6GOhX3IO1ltaVIl8RjWwf/) by Imran Teli.

Moreover I will deploy those projects as IaC using terraform in order to practice my terraform skills.

## Projects

- [Hands-on-0:](/hands_on_0/README.md) Set up the aws account
- [Hands-on-1:](/hands_on_1/README.md) Deploy a web app
